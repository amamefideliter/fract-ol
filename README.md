# fract-ol
fract-ol is a graphical application that generates and displays fractal sets, including the Mandelbrot, Julia, and Tricorn (bonus) fractals. The program allows for real-time interaction with the fractals, including zooming that follows the mouse cursor.
## Features
- Mandelbrot Set: A classic fractal set that demonstrates complex behavior within simple rules.
- Julia Set: Another famous fractal, closely related to the Mandelbrot, but each point on the complex plane represents a unique fractal.
-  Tricorn Set (Bonus): An anti-holomorphic variation of the Mandelbrot set, which results in unique and visually interesting patterns.
-  Mouse-controlled zoom: Zoom into specific parts of the fractal by hovering the mouse cursor and using scroll actions, providing a dynamic exploration experience.
- Imaginary number operations: Several mathematical functions are implemented to work with imaginary numbers, making the fractal calculations more efficient.
